> KuroCMS admin · article management — multilingual, per‑article SNS publish state, and one‑click build.

KuroCMS is a lightweight headless CMS that runs **entirely on the Cloudflare global
network** (Workers + D1 + KV + R2). It pairs a polished admin with high‑performance
edge delivery — and is designed so a typical blog runs comfortably **within
Cloudflare's free tier**.

## ✨ Why KuroCMS

- 🚀 **Cloudflare‑native & fast** — Workers + D1 + KV + R2, edge‑cached static delivery.
- 💸 **Runs for ¥0** — built around Cloudflare's free tier: no rental server, no DB ops.
- 🧩 **PC‑free web installer** — provisions D1 / KV / R2 / Worker into *your* Cloudflare account straight from the browser. No CLI, no build.
- 🌐 **Multilingual by design** — one shared article identity, per‑language static output, AI‑friendly translation API.
- ✍️ **Rich WYSIWYG editor (KuroEditor)** — callouts, round boxes, tables, media — with **passkey (WebAuthn)** sign‑in and multi‑device recovery.
- 🎨 **Community templates** — pick a shareable template and make it yours.
- 🤖 **AI‑ready REST API** — clean JSON endpoints for automation and translation.
- 🔑 **Zero runtime dependencies** — vanilla TypeScript on the Workers runtime.
