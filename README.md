## About this repository

This repository publishes the **core source code of KuroCMS for transparency** —
so anyone (especially the security-minded) can review what the software actually
does. **You do not build or deploy from this repository.**

- **To install KuroCMS**, use the web installer:
  **<https://kuro.boo/kurocms>**
  It provisions D1 / KV / R2 / Worker into your own Cloudflare account directly
  from the browser — no local build or CLI required.
- **Release history** — versions, change notes, and the built `worker.js` — is on
  the [Releases](https://github.com/Kuro-Boo/KuroCMS-releases/releases) page.

What is published here:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `src/` | Cloudflare Worker source (the CMS itself) |
| `migrations/` | D1 database schema migrations |

Build tooling, configuration, dependencies, and maintainer scripts are
intentionally omitted — this is a source-review mirror, not a build target.
